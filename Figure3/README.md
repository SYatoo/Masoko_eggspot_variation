Fig. 4. Developmental function of oca2 locus. 
(A) Adult phenotype of amelanistic oca2 homozygous null mutant. 
(B) Adult phenotype of melanistic sibling. 
(C) Stereomicroscope image of oca2 null mutant at post-hatching stage. White inset box corresponds to C’ showing coverage of iridophore-based reflectance on the trunk. 
(D) Stereomicroscope image of melanistic sibling at post-hatching stage. White inset box corresponds to D’ showing coverage of iridophore-based reflectance on the trunk. 
(E) Quantification of iridophore coverage in trunk across five clutches at early stages (post-hatching embryos to newly free-swimming juveniles, 10-25 dpf), measured by percentage of pixels in the selected region with value above the threshold (see methods), showing the difference between amelanistic and melanistic siblings (p=0.000000000639, two-way ANOVA). 
(F) Representative image of the first defined event in aggregation formation, the appearance of elongate iridophores (grey arrow) in the position of the future aggregation. 
(G) Representative image of the second defined event in aggregation formation, the overlaying of elongate iridophores (grey arrow) with xanthophores (orange arrow). 
(H) Representative image of the third defined event in aggregation formation, the association stellate iridophores (grey arrow) overlaying xanthophores (orange arrow). 
(I) Violin plot of the number of days from the commencement of imaging at yolk closure to the three defined events in aggregation formation (F-H), showing the difference in timing specifically of the change to stellate iridophore morphology between amelanistic and melanistic siblings (mean 24.5 days for melanistics and 57.3 for amelanistics, p = 0.0010, two-way ANOVA). 
(J) Representative image of anal fin of amelanistic oca2 null mutant at stage of initial aggregation formation. Inset white box J’ shows close-up of aggregation. Sibling of L at same timepoint. 
(K) Representative image of anal fin of amelanistic oca2 null mutant at end of imaging series. Sibling of M. 
(L) Representative image of anal fin of melanistic sibling at stage of initial aggregation formation. Inset white box L’ shows close-up of aggregation. Sibling of J at same timepoint. 
(M) Representative image of anal fin of melanistic sibling at end of imaging series. Sibling of K. 
(N) Violin plot showing the difference in the length of aggregation at early timepoint of initial aggregation formation. 
(O) Violin plot showing the difference in the egg-spot number at the end of the imaging series, the day 200 timepoint (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.01874) with no significant difference in body size differences observed between groups (two-way ANOVA, p = 0.12) (Fig. S7L). 
(P) Violin plot showing the difference in the distance along the proximal-distal axis between the aggregation and the proximal edge of the fin at the connection to the body at the final imaging timepoint (two way ANOVA, p = 0.000010).
